# The Example

This is example code showing how FontCrusher can be used to crush Font Awesome, other fonts could also be used too. This is based of the code used for my website and how I used this tool to automatically crush the icon fonts I used.

Before the compression the `.ttf` file size was 165,548 Bytes and the `.css` file was 31,000 Bytes after crushing both the `.ttf`and `.css` the file sizes were 3,276 Bytes and 3,995 Bytes respectively. That is a saving of 189277 Bytes (189 kB) which is 3.4% of the orignial file size.

    (165,548+31,000)-(3,276+3,995) = 189277 Bytes (189 kB)
    (3,276+3,995)/(165,548+31,000) = 3.4%.

This code can be copy-pasted and only minor edits are needed to change it to use within your projects.
